# Querydoc
## Overview
Querydoc is a **search engine** which directly show you **code implementations**. Programmers will **select and index their code** with our CLI or plugin (CLI always needed). This code will be linked to this matched **comment** and will be available with a simple search on our browser. QueryDoc will be useful to **easily** make accessible **API's documentations**, **code examples** etc...
